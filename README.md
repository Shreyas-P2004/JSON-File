# Data-Analysis
Developed a project in tableau involving data analysis and forensic technology by creating data dashboard.

1)Firstly downloaded the dataset and imported into the tableau software.

2)Created a calculated measure field called "Unhealthy" with a value of 10 for every unhealthy status (representing 10 mins of potential down time since the previous message).

3)Created a bar graph to get the downtime per factory.

4)Created a new bar graph for down time per device type.

5)Created a dashbord by drawing the insights from the above two visualization sheets which are the downtime per factory and downtime per device type.
