# Data-Analysis
Developed a project in tableau involving data analysis and forensic technology by creating data dashboard.

1)Firstly downloaded the dataset and imported into the tableau software.

2)Created a calculated measure field called "Unhealthy" with a value of 10 for every unhealthy status (representing 10 mins of potential down time since the previous message).

3)Created a bar graph to get the downtime per factory.

4)Created a new bar graph for down time per device type.

5)Created a dashbord by drawing the insights from the above two visualization sheets which are the downtime per factory and downtime per device type.

# Dataset used

# Process
The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify “level of gender pay equality” for most job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it would be a great idea for you to finish the job.

Created a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
